Vis.js runs fine on Chrome,\nFirefox, Opera, Safari, IE9+, and most mobile browsers (with full touch\nsupport). This site contains documentation, downloads and live examples of\nvis.js. The sourcecode of vis.js is available at Github. For questions,\nissues, and suggestions please use the issues section of the Github project.\n\n### install with npm (recommended)\n\n    \n    \n    npm install vis\n\n### install with bower\n\n    \n    \n    bower install vis\n\n### link from cdnjs.com\n\nvis.min.js  \nvis.min.css  \n\n### download\n\nv4.21.0.zip\n\n  \n\n* * *\n\n  \n\n## Showcase; see vis in action!\n\nIn this section you can see cool projects that vis was used in.

If you\nwant to contribute, great! Here's how:\n\nFirst, fork vis on Github, then add your feature, fix a bug, rephrase our\nwriting etc. and do a pull request to the **develop branch** on Github! Pull\nrequests to the master branch will not be merged.  \n  \nIf you fork the codebase, you'll find all modules in seperate files. This\nmakes it a lot easier to work on than the distributed and combined vis.js\nfile.  \n  \nIf you want to contribute please read this HowTo!!\n\n  \n\n* * *\n\n  \n\n## Feature requests\n\nWe get a lot of feature requests on Github. Here's a list of them!\n\nThe requests that come in on Github usually have a good argumentation and a\nlot of these ideas have made it into vis! To keep a nice overview of them.

It can be evident in someone 's face, or in their body\nlanguage. Sometimes it's a judgment call. If you think it works, try it out.\nIf we delete it, you were wrong. We are Reddit\u2122 moderators. We are always\nright!\n\n>\n\n> #### **A fail is not a regret.** Some ripper eating a swellbow while trying\nto bone a rail on the backside, (that 's skater lingo for a bad crash. I\nlooked it up (made it up)), isn't regret. There should be a look of surprise,\nand an expression that clearly says, \"Oh no. Oh, God no. I really should not\nhave done that. Why did I do that?\"\n\n>\n\n> #### **Eating bad food and not liking it is not regret.** You knew what was\ngoing to happen, dumbass.\n\n>\n\n> #### **Laughter is not an expression of regret.** It 's just not.\n\n>\n\n> #### **We only accept videos hosted on either imgur, i.reddituploads,\ngfycat, streamable, or YouTube.** Our robot sends everything else to Hell.\n\n>\n\n> #### **If the video is longer than 20 seconds,** please use a tag to tell\neveryone when the lead-up to the regrettable moment begins. For example\n[regret at 4:20]. Or post the video queued up to the point where things get\ngood and the regret quickly follows. But, ultimately, these are just excellent\nsuggestions. You 're the director. Make it good. And don't worry. If it sucks,\nwe'll get rid of it for you.\n\n>\n\n> #### **No compilations.** Just pick one good thing and go with it. Everybody\nlikes it when you do that.\n\n>\n\n> #### **We love animals.** They are capable of regret, but we don 't want to\nsee videos where their regret is the fault of humans, involves cruelty, injury\nor is in any way unpleasant.\n\n>\n\n> #### **No Dannys.** If your name is Danny and we find out we will ban you.\n\n* * *\n\n> ### WE HATE SPAM!\n\n>\n\n> #### We remove spam.\n\n>\n\n> #### We exact vengeance on those who give us spam.\n\n>\n\n> #### If you see spam, report spam.\n\n>\n\n> #### If you see an account that uses a YouTube channel that takes videos\nfrom other channels in order to accumulate karma on said account. **Report\nthat account,** We 'll take care of it.\n\n* * *\n\n> #### and finally...\n\n>\n\n> ### REMEMBER YOUR REDDIQUETTE\n\n>\n\n> #### Please, no abusive comments, hate speech, or any other personal\nattacks.\n\n>\n\n> #### Doxing, brigading, and witch-hunting are not allowed.\n\n>\n\n> #### This includes derailing commentary sections to complain about prolific\nusers, and by that we mean \"Gallowboob is not against the rules\". Complaining\nabout the OP rather than the content is an easy way to earn a temporary ban.\n\n>\n\n> #### The moderators reserve the right to remove posts & comments, and to ban\nusers at our own discretion. If we feel your post doesn't fit, we'll remove\nit. If you are an abusive person, or an intolerable troll, we just might ban\nyou.

It was\ngetting dark and we were tired from walking around all day so we got on the\nmonorail and just rode it to the last stop and back. My mom was sitting\nbetween my younger brother and myself, with my older brother, Sam, sitting\naccross from us. Before we reached the end, Sam decided he wanted to take a\nphoto of the three of us with the disposable camera he had brought. Now, he\nhad been a dick of an older brother all day and I was tired of his shit, so I\nflipped him off during the taking of the photo, making sure to keep my hand\ntucked where my mom couldn't see. Fast forward to a few weeks later when my\nmom gets the film developed. I got home from school and she was waiting in the\nliving room with the photos, the one on top being the one my brother took of\nus on the monorail, and there it is. Front and center.

Photo: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nWhen the president threatened China with $100 billion in new tariffs, there\nhad hardly been any White House discussion.\n\n**What I\u2019m hearing:** There wasn\u2019t one single deliberative meeting in which\nsenior officials sat down to debate the pros and cons of this historic threat.\nTrump didn\u2019t even ask for advice from his new top economic adviser, Larry\nKudlow, instead presenting the tariffs as a fait accompli. Chief of Staff John\nKelly knew Trump wanted more tariffs but was blindsided by the speed of the\nannouncement. And Legislative Affairs Director Marc Short \u2014 the White House\u2019s\nliaison to Capitol Hill \u2014 was totally in the dark.\n\nRead more toggle\n\nShow less\n\nKeep reading263 Words\n\nTo be sure, the president wasn\u2019t completely freelancing. The topic came up at\nthe senior staff meeting the morning of the announcement. And he personally\nordered Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to put together the threat and to\nget it done by Thursday. Trump said he had to protect American farmers, whom\nthe Chinese were threatening with billions in tariffs.\n\nBut for some White House officials, the moment was jarring: Trump had melted\ndown Capitol Hill and roiled the markets with zero substantive internal\ndebate.\n\nSeveral senior officials blame Mnuchin for the messy rollout. One source\nripped him for \u201chiding the ball\u201d by not looping enough people in after getting\nsuch a significant request from Trump.\n\nAnother senior administration official defended Mnuchin, noting that after\ngetting the order from Trump, he told the Staff Secretary and had multiple\nconversations with trade representative Bob Lighthizer, who worked in lockstep\nwith him on this. The senior official also pointed out that no tariffs have\nbeen implemented yet, and that this was just a statement. (Though sources who\nwere caught off guard say this wasn\u2019t any old statement; Trump was effectively\ndeclaring a trade war against China.)\n\n **Why this matters:** Trump isn\u2019t just emboldened; he\u2019s unleashed \u2014 bringing\nthe U.S. to the brink of a trade war at a breakneck pace.\n\n **What\u2019s next:** Free-traders like Kudlow hope to lower the temperature and\navoid a tit-for-tat with China on tariffs that could be economically\ndisastrous. But with Trump as mercurial as he is, any soothing words from\nKudlow should be taken with a very large grain of salt.\n\nPlus box\n\nPolitics\n\nfacebook\n\ntwitter\n\nlinkedin\n\ncopy\n\nhttps://www.axios.com/facebooks-final-pre-hearing-\npush-1523245562-e7d4b9ea-67ee-4112-bb59-4cc8aaca0de4.html\n\nSara Fischer 3 mins ago\n\nSaveSave story\n\n### Zuckerberg to make Capitol Hill rounds before testimony\n\nPhoto by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is expected to meet with some lawmakers Monday,\nhis latest maneuver to prepare for hearings in front of three congressional\ncommittees this week, Reuters reports.\n\n **Why it matters:** Last week Zuckerberg and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg\nworked the media, doing roughly a dozen interviews collectively. As Zuckerberg\nheads into trial mode this week, he\u2019s expected to keep a low media profile and\ninstead focus his efforts chiefly on Capitol Hill.\n\nRead more toggle\n\nShow less\n\nKeep reading180 Words\n\n **What he 's doing:**\n\n  1.  **Zuckerberg will hold meetings** with some U.S. lawmakers ahead of his hearings on Monday, sources tell Reuters. The meetings are said to include some members of the committees that will be questioning Zuckerberg later in the week. \n  2. **Facebook has hired a team of experts,** including a former special assistant to President George W. Bush, to give Zuckerberg \"a crash course in humility and charm,\" The New York Times reports. \n  3. **The company willnotify users** whose data may have been provided to Cambridge Analytica on Monday. \n  4. **Facebook has been taking action** on more third-party data vendors ahead of the testimony. It suspended data analytics firm CubeYou, after CNBC found that the organization used personality quizzes that were labeled as \"non-profit academic research\" to help advertisers target customers, a similar tactic to those used by Cambridge Analytica.\n\n **Be smart** : Facebook faces a real prospect of regulation, and its camera-\nshy CEO has never testified before Congress and has no Washington experience.\nHow well he satisfies lawmakers will shape whether those regulations turn out\nfriendly or tough.\n\nPlus box\n\nTechnology\n\nfacebook\n\ntwitter\n\nlinkedin\n\ncopy"], ["https://www.reddit.com/r/all/", "# whoa there, pardner!\n\nwe're sorry, but you appear to be a bot and we've seen too many requests from\nyou lately. we enforce a hard speed limit on requests that appear to come from\nbots to prevent abuse.\n\nif you are not a bot but are spoofing one via your browser's user agent\nstring: please change your user agent string to avoid seeing this message\nagain.\n\nplease wait 7 second(s) and try again.\n\nas a reminder to developers, we recommend that clients make no more than one\nrequest every two seconds to avoid seeing this message."], ["https://www.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/", "# whoa there, pardner!\n\nwe're sorry, but you appear to be a bot and we've seen too many requests from\nyou lately. we enforce a hard speed limit on requests that appear to come from\nbots to prevent abuse.\n\nif you are not a bot but are spoofing one via your browser's user agent\nstring: please change your user agent string to avoid seeing this message\nagain.\n\nplease wait 7 second(s) and try again.\n\nas a reminder to developers, we recommend that clients make no more than one\nrequest every two seconds to avoid seeing this message."], ["https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWNCwlrboBU", "Skip navigation\n\nSign in\n\nSearch\n\nLoading...\n\nClose\n\nYeah, keep it Undo Close\n\n#  This video is unavailable.\n\n### Watch Queue\n\n### Queue\n\nWatch QueueQueue\n\n  * Remove all\n  * Disconnect\n\nThe next video is startingstop\n\nLoading...\n\nWatch Queue\n\nQueue\n\n__count__/__total__\n\n##  Ditch the ads.\n\nLoading...\n\nWant music and videos with zero ads?
